/**
 * The ADMIN client - the credential a server holds, with a real API in front
 * of it.
 *
 * Distinct from `./client` in three ways that matter:
 *
 * - **It targets the CONSOLE, never an agent.** A service key (`fsb_`, or a legacy `cfbs_`) is
 *   verified in the console guard and travels to the agent over a service
 *   binding the console already authorized; the agent worker never sees the
 *   bearer, and a key does not work on `/agents/*` at all. So `url` here is the
 *   console origin, not an agent base.
 * - **It is admin-grade.** Every route it calls bypasses access modes,
 *   document validators, and permission keys - the Firestore-Admin-SDK
 *   contract. A malformed document written through this client is NOT caught by
 *   rules-lite. That is not a bug to report; it is what an operator surface is.
 * - **It is server-only**, enforced twice over (see `assertServerOnly`).
 *
 * It lives in this package rather than a standalone one because it wraps the
 * DB AGENT's admin routes: when the agent gains a route, the client for it
 * ships in the same version. The console is the transport, not the subject.
 *
 * Method names mirror `./client` wherever the operation is the same, so the
 * two read alike.
