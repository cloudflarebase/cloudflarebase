/**
 * CSRF, credential-aware - replacing SvelteKit's blanket check, which is
 * disabled in svelte.config.js (`csrf.checkOrigin: false`) precisely so this
 * can run instead. Never delete one without the other.
 *
 * THE ATTACK: a page on evil.com submits a form to this origin. The browser
 * attaches the visitor's session cookie automatically, so the request runs as
 * them. Browsers can only do this without asking permission for three content
 * types - the ones a plain HTML form can produce - so refusing those on a
 * cross-origin write is the defence, and it is exactly SvelteKit's rule.
 *
 * WHY IT NEEDED REPLACING: SvelteKit treats a MISSING Origin as cross-site.
 * A service-key request has no Origin BY CONSTRUCTION - the guard refuses the
 * key outright if one is present - and `fetch` defaults a string body to
 * `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`, `JSON.stringify(...)` included. So the most
 * natural call a server can write was refused 403 before the key was ever
 * read, on the primary documented server path rather than some edge.
 *
 * WHY SKIPPING ON A BEARER IS SOUND: CSRF works only because the browser
 * supplies the credential by itself. It never adds a `Bearer` Authorization
 * header on its own, and a cross-origin fetch that sets one triggers a CORS
 * preflight this app does not answer for untrusted origins. So a request
 * carrying one cannot have been forged by a victim's browser - and an
 * attacker who already knows the bearer does not need CSRF at all. Cookie
 * requests keep the full check.
 *
 * The skip is BEARER-shaped only, not any Authorization header: every
 * credential this app accepts is a bearer (session token or service key),
 * while `Basic` is one a browser CAN attach by itself (a `user:pass@host`
 * top-level navigation), riding beside the victim's cookies
 * on a request the guard would then authenticate from those cookies. A
 * non-bearer Authorization therefore keeps the full check.
 *
 * SvelteKit applies this before ANY hook, so the replacement sits first in the
 * sequence - ahead of the rate limiter and the guard - to keep the same
 * ordering guarantee.

/**
 * The hosted console moved from cloudflarebase.com to frostbase.dev. The old
 * hostname stays attached to this Worker (MOVED_FROM_HOSTS) so links, bookmarks
 * and search results land on the same path at CANONICAL_ORIGIN.
 *
 * Pages redirect; the API does NOT. `/api/*` and `/agents/*` keep answering on
 * the old host, because an integration that hard-codes the old base URL would
 * otherwise break: a cross-origin fetch only follows a redirect that itself
 * passes CORS, and a redirected POST is a request no client should have to
 * re-send. Unset vars (self-hosted, local, e2e) make this a no-op.
